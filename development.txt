1) create virtualenvironment using virtualenv-it is mostly installed so just run "virtualenv <name of environment>"
2) activate it by going to the activate folder of the virtual environment folder
<name of virtuenvironment>\Scripts\activate---this is in windows
in MAC OS, use source <name of virtual environment>/bin/activate
3) create and make changes in all of the html, css, and js files as required
4) store badger id in .env file(create both .env and .gitignore files)
5) note: we have decised a method which helps read our badger id directly frorm the badger-config.js file
and then we don't have to put it again even if we refresh
BUT: we have to first manually put it by ourselves in a new browser which hasn't cookied out badger id
so if we go and open idnex.html file in a new browser with a new chrome profile then for the first time
we load index.html we have to manually enter the badger id into the text box and then 
from the second time, we woon't havr to manually enter it in that same chrome profile for 
that browser.
